My expectations in CMSC 100 is that it will be difficult based on my classmates' expectations earlier in class. 
With all the negative experiences that my classmates or their upper classmen had, I feel like my experience with this class would somehow mirror what they experienced. 
At first, I felt excited taking this web devolopment class. 
Now i feel more anxious than excited. 
However I still am hoping for a far better outcome. 

"It's okay to feel that way. 
Use this apprehension to motivate you to prepare, study, or work harder to achieve your goals. 
Remember, you are not alone in this journey; take one step at a time and believe in your abilities, just as you've successfully overcome challenges before. 
May the far better outcome you're hoping for surpass even your wildest imagination, becoming the very best. - Aira Moon"
