My expectations in CMSC 100 is that it will be difficult based on my classmates' expectations earlier in class. With all the negative experiences that my classmates or their upper classmen had, I feel like my experience with this class would somehow mirror what they experienced. At first, I felt excited taking this web devolopment class. Now i feel more anxious than excited. However I still am hoping for a far better outcome.

Hi Kuya Luel! I share your anxieties as to the challenging road ahead of us. I've failed CMSC 100 already before and I can
attest to our peers' stories of how difficult this course really is. However, I encourage you to channel your excitement and
drive to learn. You've come this far already and I believe that you have what it takes to go even further.
